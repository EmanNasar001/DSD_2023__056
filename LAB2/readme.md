# Experiment 2
## Combinational Circuits:Structural Modeling using Vivado
 In this experiment we used Vivado to design  and implement the circuit given in .drawio file by writing its code in System Verilog there  and later on we  used it for running our code on FPGA.
 ### Files:
 readme.md
 
 Diagram(.drawio)
 
 design file(.sv)
 
 constraint file(.xdc)
 ### Process:
 First i made a truth table decoding the circuit given in diagram as in .drawio file then expressed the truth table through boolean equation and implemented the boolean equatian in design file through code ,defined constraints  and checked for parameters like schematics ,and combinational delays of different paths of circuit
 ### Conclusion:
 This experiment helped me to understand the implementation of combinational circuits  on FPGA through vivado using System Verilog .It was a brief and meaningful introduction to System Verilog and Vivado.
