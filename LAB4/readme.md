# Experiment 4:
## Combinational Circuit Design: RGB  LED using K-Maps
### Description:
In this experiment we developed the logic to get the desired output using   the required K-maps.Our desired output is listed as below:

F =

a > b P urple

a = b Y ellow

a < b Cyan

We were asked to design the circuit keeping RGB combinations in mind. Then we implemented the equations from K-map in System Verilog code u
using Vivado.Later we verified our code through Questasim testbench simulation.Final testing was done on FPGA .
