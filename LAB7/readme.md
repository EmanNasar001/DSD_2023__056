### Experiment 7

## Sequential Circuit Design: Clock Manipulation
## Task:

This experiment is basically a level up to experiment 5 in this experiment we were required to store the numbers in our Seven segments by using a key named write when write is 1 we are resd to save our numbers from 0 to 16(0to F ) and when write is 0 we are required to display all saved number at once by using clock manipulation by bringing down original clck value of 100MHz down to approx 100Hz so we could observe all saved numbers at once.


## Details 

We designed first by drawing our initial diagram them implementing the diagram in Vivado design file and later tested in Questasim.
