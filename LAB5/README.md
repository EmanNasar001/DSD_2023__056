# EXPERIMENT 5
## Combinational Circuit Design: Seven  Segments Display using K-Maps
## Description :
In this experiment we  designed  the driver circuit for the seven segments display, and we learned about selection choices as well. 
We made truth tables separately for cathodes as well as for anodes.Then deduced equations from K-maps and later implemented those equations in
Vivado through both structural and behavioural models of design .Later we tested our designs on Vvivado
